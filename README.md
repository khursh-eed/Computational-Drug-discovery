A regression model for Human acetylcholinesterase inhibitors
Bioactivity data for human acetylcholinesterase was extracted from the ChEMBL database and preprocessed.(extraction from chembl takes really long, so extracted csv file uploaded)
The Lipinski Rule of Five was applied to evaluate drug-likeness. Statistical analysis was conducted on two classesâ€”active and inactive compounds. Results indicated significant differences in all four Lipinski parameters between active and inactive compounds. Molecular descriptors were calculated to quantitatively describe the compounds, forming a dataset for model building. A Random Forest regression model for acetylcholinesterase inhibitors was developed using the random forest algorithm.

Model can be trained using the code provided
